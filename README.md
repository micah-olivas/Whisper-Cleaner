# Whisper-Cleaner
Whisper Cleaner leverages timestamped multi-lingual speech-to-text generation to recognize and remove language deemed obscene, indecent, or profane by the FCC from audio intended for radio and television broadcasts. The package uses **whisper-timestamped** from linto-ai for text generation and mapping, and **profanity-check** from vzhou842 for profanity prediction.
